Issue #1: Grabbing config values from olin.cfg and inserting into motor module.

Debug 1: Call "ConfigOption('name') but does not work as it only grabs the
address of the configuration file and not the actual value itself.

Debug 2: make current private variable self but still doesn't grab the
correct value.

Debug 3: Current set up but did not insert value into the "ConfigOption"
so values just returned "NONE".

Debug 4: Inserted the direct value into the private variables and
worked but is not being called dynamically.

Debug 5: Needed to call get functions instead of calling self._x_serial_number
as it would still give the address rather than the actual value.

Debug 6: Need to split all of the values up
EX. _pos_min = ConfigOption('pos_min', 0)
    _position_min = _pos_min
    def get_pos_min(self):
        return self._position_min
NOT:
    _pos_min = ConfigOption('pos_min', 0)
    self._pos_min

Issue #2: Needed to import scanner into the motor logic where
the motor logic would call both the hardware and the scanner.
This is the hierarchy where the scanner is a base class that
could be used for multiple instruments in the logic and the
logic itself would call the hardware class to execute actions.
The logic class functions are there to ensure that the
function exist and the parameters are correct before executing
directly to the hardware.
