Issue #1: Grabbing config values from olin.cfg and inserting into motor module.

Debug 1: Call "ConfigOption('name') but does not work as it only grabs the
address of the configuration file and not the actual value itself.

Debug 2: make current private variable self but still doesn't grab the
correct value.

Debug 3: Current set up but did not insert value into the "ConfigOption"
so values just returned "NONE".

Debug 4: Inserted the direct value into the private variables and
worked but is not being called dynamically.

Debug 5: Needed to call get functions instead of calling self._x_serial_number
as it would still give the address rather than the actual value.

Debug 6: Need to split all of the values up
EX. _pos_min = ConfigOption('pos_min', 0)
    _postition_min = _pos_min
    def get_pos_min(self):
        return self._position_min
NOT:
    _pos_min = ConfigOption('pos_min', 0)
    self._pos_min
